A computer vision-based application designed to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired. This system uses Python and OpenCV to capture hand gestures in real-time and translate them into text or speech.

✨ Key Features
Real-time Translation: Converts American Sign Language (ASL) gestures to text instantly.
Hand Landmark Tracking: Uses MediaPipe or OpenCV for precise finger and palm positioning.
Text-to-Speech: Integrated audio output for seamless two-way communication.
Custom Dataset Support: Easily trainable for specific regional signs or phrases.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for gesture classification)
Audio: Pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
